# Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment of text data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset of IMDb movie reviews.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the text data for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Used machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression) to train a sentiment analysis model.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using accuracy and F1 score metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib

## Key Results

- The trained model achieved an accuracy of 88% and an F1 score of 0.88.

## Usage

- Notebooks and scripts are provided for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Users can run the notebooks or scripts to reproduce the results.

## Contributions

- Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository and submit a pull request.
